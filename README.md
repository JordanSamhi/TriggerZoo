[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.5907916.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5907916)

In this repository, we host TriggerZoo, a dataset of Android apps from the Google Play automatically infected with trigger-based behavior using [AndroBomb](https://github.com/JordanSamhi/AndroBomb).

## Dataset access

For obvious reasons, the apps are not directly and publicly accessible.
The apps are only responsibly shared to authenticated and identified researchers.

This work is intended for research purposes, therefore individuals interested to manipulate this dataset should request an access to [Androzoo](https://androzoo.uni.lu) in which the apps are available.
